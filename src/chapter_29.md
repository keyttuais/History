# Indian National Movement : First Phase (1885-1915)

- The second half of the 19th century witnesses the emergence of national political consciousness and growth of organised national movement in India.
- A new feeling of oneness and belongingness to the same nation also arised. It gave a new and different path to the movement for independence **Swaraj**.

## Emergence of Nationalism in India
- Consciousness of a common nation began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that come into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers.

### Causes and Rise of Nationalism
- Different causes that led to the rise of nationalism in India are as follows : 
#### Differences in interests of Indians and Britishers
- The root problem of British rule was its selfish interest which was totally different from Indian people. They rules over India and always prioritised their interests over Indian welfare. Indians realised that their interests were being sacrificed over British manufacturers.
- Educated Indians were also dissatisfied with acquired knowledge about economic and political exploits by the British.
- The ruin of Indian economic conditions was also due to this very fact, India was dumped with cheaply made products from machines that destroyed Indian Handicrafts. And at the same place nothing was done in respect of industrialisation in India.
- The peasants also realised that they were suffering due to foreign rule, who took away large part of their produce as revenue, and the police, courts, favoured and protected the *Zamindars* and landlords, who took heavy rents and exploited them.
- They realised *British Capitalism* was not going to modernise Indian economic systems and British policies were meant to help British Capitalists.
- Heavy tarrifs, taxation, and transport policies didn't help Indian capitalists, who were competing against industries favoured by the British.
