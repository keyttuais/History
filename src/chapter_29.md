# Indian National Movement : First Phase (1885-1915)

- The second half of the 19th century witnesses the emergence of national political consciousness and growth of organised national movement in India.
- A new feeling of oneness and belongingness to the same nation also arised. It gave a new and different path to the movement for independence **Swaraj**.

## Emergence of Nationalism in India
- Consciousness of a common nation began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that come into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers.

### Causes and Rise of Nationalism
- Different causes that led to the rise of nationalism in India are as follows : 
#### Differences in interests of Indians and Britishers
- The root problem of British rule was its selfish interest which was totally different from Indian people. They rules over India and always prioritised their interests over Indian welfare. Indians realised that their interests were being sacrificed over British manufacturers.
- Educated Indians were also dissatisfied with acquired knowledge about economic and political exploits by the British.
- The ruin of Indian economic conditions was also due to this very fact, India was dumped with cheaply made products from machines that destroyed Indian Handicrafts. And at the same place nothing was done in respect of industrialisation in India.
- The peasants also realised that they were suffering due to foreign rule, who took away large part of their produce as revenue, and the police, courts, favoured and protected the *Zamindars* and landlords, who took heavy rents and exploited them.
- They realised *British Capitalism* was not going to modernise Indian economic systems and British policies were meant to help British Capitalists.
- Heavy tarrifs, taxation, and transport policies didn't help Indian capitalists, who were competing against industries favoured by the British.
#### Administrative and Economic Unification
- The sentiments of the nation grew among people after 1857 as India was unified and sense of nationalism emreged during the 19th and 20th centuries.
- The British gradually introduced a uniform system and modern system of government throughout the country and in this way unified it administratively.
- As an economic unit, the country had became a unit and the destruction of local self-sufficient and rural economy interlinked the economic life of different parts of the country. If one area was under drought or famine others also felt shortages of food and prices fluctuations.
- **Introduction of Telegraph, railways** and **unified postal system** had also brought different areas of India together and increased mutual contacts among Indians, particularly among the leaders.
#### Growth of Press, Newspapers and Literature
- The main medium through which the Indian people of nationalist mindset spread their message of patriotism and modern ideas, thoughts, about social, economic conditions was the press.
- Many newspapers with nationalist thoughts emerged during the second half of the 19th century.
- They criticised British policies, perspectives of Indians were put forward, people were involved to unite and work for national betterment.
- Ideas of self-government, democracy and industries were brought in popular mass discussion by the press and newspapers. It also brought people living in different parts of the country together, and helped them exchange their views
> Prominent Nationalist Writers of the period :
> Many novels, essays, patriotic poetry were written by writers like *Bankin Chandra Chatterjee*, Rabindranath Tagore in Bengali, Laxminath Bezbaruah in Assamese, Vishnu Shastri Chplunkar in Marathi, Subramaniyam Bharthi in Tamil.
> **Bharatendu Harishchandra** (the first writer in Hindi) and **Atlaf Husain Hali** (Urdu writer) were famous in this period. They helped in arousing feeling of patriotism and national consciousness in the country through their writings.
#### Modern Western Education and Thoughts
- In the 19th century, many Indians who were educated in Western education learnt and adapted a rational, secular. democratic, and nationalist political viewpoint. They admired and had inspirations fromn contemporary nationalist movements of European nations.
- These educated people assumed the leadership of the national movement and gave it democratic and modern direction.
- English language also provided a certain uniformity and community among educated Indians, and helped the speed of ideas between these people.

#### Effects of Contemporary World Movements
- Modern educated Indians found their political guide in Rousseau, Paine, John Stuart Mill and other IW'estern thinkers.
- They had their political heroes in Mazzini, Garibaldi and Irish nationalist leaders. These movements in Italy. South American nations where new states were being established provided a dream to Indian leaders of a free Indian nation.
#### Cultural and HIstorical Invocation of India's Past
- People of India had lost confidence in their own potential of self-government. Byiii,fficials, aid some British thinkers Constantly wrote about this.
- Nationalist writers, like RG Bhandarkar, R L Mitra and later Swami Vivekananda helped form a new picture and encouraged people to respect their own self and countered this propaganda.
- Nationalists pointed to Indian heritage of culture and rules of Ashoka, Chandragupta Maurya, Akbar etc. They helped people to have faith, think of self-government, and throwing away chains of British rule over India.

#### Socio-Religious Reform Movements
- In light of Western and modern education, a new temperament developed through which religious, social, and other traditions were relooked and reformed were promoted.
- Steps were taken by new organisations that were established in the country, e.g., Brahma Samaj, Paramhans Mandali, Prarthana Samaj, Arya Samaj and Mohammedan Literary Society etc.
#### Apathetic Attitude and Reactionary policies of Lytton
- There was an attitude of racial superiority by Britishers and deliberate discrimination against Indians was done.
- Indians felt disgusted by such treatment and actions of officials.
- Lytton who served as Viceroy from 1876-1880, reduced the age limit of Indian Civil Service (ICS) examimation from 21 years to 18 years to make it difficult for Indians to join in 1876.
- He held Delhi Darbar in 1877 which was heavily criticised as India was reeling under famine that time.
- Major Acts such as the Vernacular Act, Arms Act both passed in 1878 instigated a new front of opposition in the country.

#### Illbert Bill Controversy
- During the period of Lord Ripon (1880-84) who came after Lytton, had the controversy of introducing Ilbert Bill.
- The Bill was supposed to end the judicial disqualification on the basis of race differences but it was shelved because of opposition by Europeans.
- Thus, Bill's original purpose was gone as it was modified to keep the favour in place of Europeans.
- This made it clear to nationalist leaders that fairness and justice could not be expected from british Empire and made it clear that only united they could fight against the British.
- They also learnt how to agitate, put forth demands by agitations of Europeans who were against the Bill.
### Political Associations before Establishment of Indian National Congress
- By the 1870s, Indian nationalism had gathered enough strength and momentum to appear as a major force on the Indian political scene.
- The Indian National Congress., founded in December 1885, was the first organised expression of the Indian National Movement on an all-India scale. However, it had many predecessors.
- Raja Ram Mohan Roy was the first Indian leader to start an agitation for political reforms in India. Many public associations were started in different parts of India after 1836. Most of these were dominated by rich and aristocratic people and they were regional or local in nature.
- These usually worked for reforms in administration, association of Indians in administration and spread of education and were usually dealing with petitions being sent to the British Parliament with demands of Indians.
### Establishment of Indian National Congress
- Many Indian people have been planning for an All India Organisation of political nature for workers and activists
- It was AO Hume, a retired English Civil Servant who founded the Indian National Congress in 1885. AO Hume got in touch with famous Indian leaders of that time, and with their support the first session of Indian National Congress (INC) was held at Bombay in December, 1885.
- First President of INC was WC Bonnerjee and the first session of Congress was attended by 72 delegates.
- From here, each Congress session was held every year in December in different states of the country each time.
- Dadabhai Naoroji was the President of Congress three times. Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozshah Mehta, Bomesh Chandra Dutt, Gopal Krishna Gokhale were ther leaders who became President of INC in its early phase.
- Before this, two sessions of the Indian National Conference were held in 1883 and 1885 which had representatives from all over India.
#### Purpose and Objectives of INC
- In the First session of Indian National Congress, President WC Bonnerjee declared these to be its objectives: Training and organisation of public opinion in the country.
- Promotion of friendly relations between nationalist political workers from different parts of the country.
- Development and consolidation of the feeling of national unity irrespective of caste, religion or province
- Formulation of popular demands.
- Presentation of these demands before the British Government.
#### Safety Valve Theory
- Various safety valve theorists states that AO Hume founded Indian National Congress. He encouraged it to give a 'safety valve' or a safe path to vent out the increasing discontent and dissatisfaction among educated Indians.
- He was the one who convinced Lord Dufferin not to hinder the formation of Congress.
- The 'Safety Valve Theory' is partially correct, as modern historians disagrees with it. They say that Congress represented thoughts of Indian political leaders. They knew, if such an organisation is founded, it would have met with stiff opposition from the British Government.
- According to Bipin Chandra, Indian leaders cooperated with Hume whose ideas were not evil and had love and respect for India and its poor people.
#### Attitude of British Power Towards Congress
- British officials were hostile to the rising nationalist movement and had become suspicious of the National Congress.
- Dufferin tried to persuade Hume to devote Congress to only social work and not political affairs.
- After Congress leaders refused to limit themselves only to social affairs, British Officials realised Congress had become a tool in hands of Indian leaders, It was the focus of Indian nationalism and they began to criticise it openly and its leaders.
- British officials from 1887 in Madras Presidency became totally against Congress. Dufferin Jabelled nationalist leaders as disloyal babus, seditious brahmins and violent villains. The Congress was termed as a Factory of sedition.
- As Congress was uniting people and country, British officials used the policy of divide and rule'. They encouraged Sayyid Ahmed Khan, Raja Shiva Prasad of Benaras and other pro-British individuals to start an Anti-Congress Movement.
- British also tried to start a communal divergence by putting Hindu and Muslim interests. They offered Concessions to one and repressed the other to put down nationalism.
- However, these efforts failed to limitise the growth of the national movement.
## Moderate and Extremists Phase of Congress
First phase of Indian National Movement's can be further divided into two phases on the basis of policies and actions of Congress.
### Moderate Phase (1885 to 1905)
- In the beginning of the Congress, there was dominance of leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, MG Ranade, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, WC Bonnerjee, SN Banarjee, Pherozshah Mehta etc. They were firm believers in liberalism and a 'moderate' way of struggle.
- Moderates organised a powerful agitation against nearly all important official economic policies based on colonial structure.
- They opposed the British attempt to develop in India, making it supplier of raw materials, a market for British manufacturers and a field of investment for foreign capital.
- Moderates also complained of growing poverty and economic backwardness. They considered British exploitation the reason behind the failure of modern industry and low agricultural productivity to grow.
- Early moderates complained of the wealth of India being drained and demanded reduction of land revenue in order to lighten the burden of taxation on the peasants.
- Moderates in the early phase were not in favour of direct attack on the British Government and chose to work under such a system, but criticised the administration and policies.
#### Methods of Political Work of Moderates
- Early moderates as they believed that if public opinion was created and organised.
- They presented popular demands to the authorities through petitions, meetings, resolutions and speeches. The authorities would concede these demands gradually and step by step.
- They used 3Ps- Petitions, Protests and Prayers for these demands.
- They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country.
- They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion.
- They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians.
- Therefore, it was necessary to express these demands and make the government avware of the feelings of Indians.
#### Propaganda of Moderates in England 
- To persuade the British Government and public opinion in England in Indian favour, many steps were taken by AO Hume, Dadabhai Naoroji and William Wedderburn.
- For this, many newspapers, mnagazines were started and associations were set up in England.\
- In 1887, Dadabhai Naoroji established the Indian Reform Committee in England.
- In 1888, with the association of William Digby, Dadabhai Naoroji set up the Indian Political Agency to hear the grievances of Indians.
- In 1889, British Committee of Congress was set up, which also published a monthly magazine named India.
- In 1890, a Committee of Representatives was sent to England by Congress to make representation of Indians in British Parliament. Members of this committee were Surendranath Banerjee, WC Bannerjee and AO Hum. With the efforts of moderates in England, a sympathy was generated towards Indians. In 1879, Lalmohan Ghosh was sent to England to demand the posting of Indians in Civil Services.
- In the 1889 session of Congress, a Member of British House of Commons, Charles Bradella was present.
#### Demands of Moderates
- In the early phase of Congress, Moderate leaders did not ask tor independence from British rule but demanded coneessions, and presented their grievaneves which they hoped would be addressed. They asked for reforms in the following fields
  - Legislatures and its expansion
  - Posting of Indians in higher offices, exams in India and England for India in Civil Service and its Indianisation,
  - Removing the bans on press, newspapers and speeches,
  - Demand for inquiry by Royal Commission on Indian Administration,
  - Removal of taxes on salt,
  - Other industrial reforms and their promotion.
  - Repeal of the Arms Act.
#### Contributions of Moderates in Indian National Movement
- According to critics, not much was achieved by early moderates and Congress, as very few reforms were introduced of the demands made by them.
- It is partially true, but it cannot be said the early phase of moderate and Congress was a failure.
- It succeeded in creating awareness of the feeling of belonging to a common nation among people.
- It showed how politically, socially and economically their interests were intertwined.
- It trained people in political work and popularised among people the idea of democracy, liberty, nationalism and secularism.
- They exposed the true character of British rule, by showing how they used the economic resources of India for them.
- Their economic critique of imperialism served as a main base for coming years of national movement against British rule.
- It laid the foundation for national struggle which was to grow and it provided a political and economnic programme on which later political struggle could be based.
### Extremists Phase (1905-1919) 
- Over the years, the trend of radical thoughts grew and an extrenmist approach to national movements started to grow from the 1890s. By 1905 onwards, it took a concrete shape.
- Leaders of this school of thought included Raj Narain Bose, Aswini Kumnar Datta, Aurobindo Ghosh, Bipin Chandra Pal in Bengal, and Vishnu Shastri Chiplunkar and Tilak in Maharashtra.
#### Reasons for Growth of Extremism
- When the British Government was not Conceding to important demands, many of the political leaders started to feel that only an Indian Government could bring India on a path of progress attracted more and more people.
- In the years between 1896 and 1900, over 90 lakhs died because of severe famines. Bubonic plague affected large areas of Deccan, the British government failed to provide major relief and help in these areas.
- The British did not pay attention to people in distress, leaders in the Indian National Congress (INC) felt politically disappointed.
- Spread of education among the masses led to increased awareness. The rising unemployment among the educated led their attention to poverty and underdevelopment under British rule.
- International events in the 19th century encouraged extremists in India also. Progress made by Japan after 1868 and its emergence as an industrial power opened the eyes of Indians. They realised that economic progress was possible even by an Asian country without any external help.
- The defeat of the Italian army by Ethiopians (1896), the Boer Wars (1899-1902) where the British forces defeated and Japan's victory over Russia (1905) demolished myths of European invincibility.
- Also, the nationalists were inspired by the nationalist movements worldwide in Ireland, Russia, Egypt, Turkey, Persia and China.
- The Indians realised that a uniform spirit of people with will to make sacrifices could take on the mightiest of empires.
- Reacting to increasing Westernisation, the new leadership felt the stranglehold of excessive Westernisation and sensed colonial designs to submerge the Indian national identity in the British Empire.
- The intellectual and moral inspiration of the new leadership was Indian intellectuals like Swami Vivekananda, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and Swami Dayanand Saraswati.
- They inspired many young nationalists with their forceful and articulate arguments, painting India's past in brighter colours than the British ideologies had.
#### Partition of Bengal, 1905
- On 16th October, 1905, Lord Curzon had divided Bengal into Eastern Bengal (with Assam) and the rest of Bengal.
- The decision had come after Lord Curzon claimed that Bengal was too large to be governed effectively.
- The partition separated the largely Muslim Eastern areas from the largely Hindu Western areas. lt was definitely the 'divide and rule' policy for the Indians and the national leaders outraged about the fact that the British Government turning native population against itself in order to rule.
- Bengali Hindus were at the forefront of political agitation. Following the partition, an Anti-British movement began. This involved non-violent and violent protests and boycotts. The Indiarn National Congress began the Swadeshi Movement.
#### Swadeshi and Boycott Movement
- The main reason for partition of Bengal was to weaken the political struggle whose centre was in Bengal.
- Lord Curzon tried to favour the Muslims by announcing that Dacca (Dhaka) would be new capital of Muslim majority province.
- With the announcement of partition on 7th August, 1905, a Resolution of Boycott was announced in Calcutta town hall and the formal proclamation of Swadeshi Movement was made.
- On 16th October, 1905, the partition came into force, this day was observed as a day of mourning throughout Bengal.
- People bathed in Ganga and walked barefoot singing Vande Mataram which became the theme song of the movement.
- People tied rakhis on each other's hand as a symbol of unity. Surendranath Banerjee and Anand Mohan Bose addressed the gathering.
#### Position of Congress
- Under the Presidentship of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Congress in 1905, condemned partition and supported Anti Partition and Swadeshi Movement.
- In 1906, under the Presidentship of Dadabhai Naoroji the goal of Congress was declared as the 'self-government' or Swaraj.
#### Movement under Extremist Leadership
- Under Extremist leaders, boycott of foreign goods, public meetings and processions were organised.
- Samiti or corps of volunteers generated awareness. They tried to arise the sentiments of the public by songs, lectures, training in swadeshi crafts and organising courts.
- Self-reliance or Atma Shakti was encouraged, emphasis was placed on national dignity, honour, and social and economic regemeration of villages.
- A Swadeshi Programme on National Education was planned. Bengal National College was set up in 1906 (Aurobindo Ghosh as its Principal), inspired by Tagore's Shantiniketan.
- On 15th August, 1906, National Council of Education was set up Satish Chandra Mukherjee to organise National Education - literary, scientific and technical. Education was to be imparted in the vernacular medium. Bengal Institute of Technology was set up for technical education.
- Swadeshi (Indigenous) Enterprises such as : Swadeshi textile mills, soap and match factories, tanneries, banks. insurance companies, shops, etc were set up. VO Chidambaram Pillai set up the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company at Tuticorin.
- Rabindranath Tagore wrote Amar Sonar Bangla, Subramania Bharati wrote Swadesha Geetham to arouse national sentiments.
- Tilak used Ganapati and Shivaji festival as a medium of propagation of nationalist ideas. In Bengal, traditional folk theatres were used for this purpose.
#### Participation of Masses
- There was mass participation of students, and women in the Swadeshi Movement. Labour unions organised strikes in Bengal, Punjab and Tamil Nadu. So, the social base of the movement had increased.
- Muslim of upper and mildle caste didn't participate in the nnorement. People like Nawab Salimullah Dacca spperted the Bengal partition.
#### Suppression of the Movement
- The British Govenment adopted a harsh attiude towards the agitators. lndigenous activists were prosecuted and jailed.
- To end the participation of students in the Swadeshi Movement, the British Governument, on 22nd October, 1905, the Carlyle Circular was implemented.
- Under this, grants and scholarships given to educational institutions were to be stopped. The students were even given corporal punishment.
- In December 1908, 9 1leaders of Bengal were expelled from the country by the police at the Bengal Provincial Conference held at Barisal in April, 1900. Among them were Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Datta.
- After the riots in Punjab, Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were expelled from the country.
- The movement failed to create an effective organisation or a party structure. The movement was rendered leaderless with most of the leaders either arrested or deported by 1908 and with Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal retiring from active politics.
- Internal differences among leaders, magnified by the Surat Split (1907) also affected the movement.
- The movement aroused the people but did not know how to use the newly released energy or how to find new forms to give expression to popular resentment.
#### Establishment of Muslim League (1906)
- Partition of Bengal became the biggest reason for the split between Hindu and Muslim communities in India.
- The Muslim delegation under the leadership of Aga Khan met the then Viceroy Lord Minto and demanded a special status for Muslims.
- In the year 1906, Muslim League was established in Dhaka under the leadership of Salimulla Khan and Aga Khan, The first President of the League was Waqar-ul-Mulk Mustaq Hussain.
- Between the years 1905 to 1907, the mutual differences of extremist and liberal ideas grew. Moreover, the leaders of the Extremist Party did not believe in the ability of the Moderates to negotiate with the British Government.
- In the year 1905, in the Banaras Session of the Congress, both the parties reached the edge of split over the post of President.
- In the conference, Tilak wanted to make Lala Lajpat Pai the President and Bipin Chandra Pal wanted to make Tilak the President. This possibility was averted with Dadabhai Naoroji becoming the President.
#### Surat Split (1907)
- Already the tensions were high between the two groups as they both had different thoughts. Moderates didn't want to antagonise the British as council reforms were coming up. Extremists didn't realise moderates could be their defence line in case of any repression by British Officials.
- The Extremists wanted the 1907 session in Nagpur with Tilak or Lajpat Rai as the President and the Swadeshi, boycott education resolutions again to be adopted.
- Moderates wanted the session at Surat in order to avoid Tilak from the presidency, since a leader from the host province could not be session President as Surat was Tilak's home province of Bombay.
- They wanted Rashbehari Ghosh as the President and then to drop the resolutions on swadeshi, boycott and national education.
- Both sides adopted rigid positions and split became inevitable. The Congress was now dominated by the Moderates who were committed the goal of self-government and to use only constitutional methods to achieve this goal.
#### Delhi Darbar
- The Delhi Darbar was an Indian imperial style mass assembly organised by the British to mark the succession of an Emperor or Empress of India. It was held three times: in 1877, 1903 and 1911.
- The Darbar of 1877 was called Proclamation Darbar. It's organisation was undertaken by Thomas Henry Thornton.
- It was held to proclaim Queen Victoria as Empress of India by the British. It was attended by the first Earl of Lytton (Viceroy of India), many princely states and intellectuals.
- This was the culmination of transfer of control of British India from the East India Company to the crown.
- The Darbar in December 1911 was held to Commemorate the coronation of George V and Mary of Teck and to allow their proclamation as Emperor and Empress of India.
- In this Darbar, annulment of partition of Bengal and he transfer of India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi Were announced.
## First phase of revolutionary activities (1907-17)
- The beginning of revolutionary ideology and activities in Indian were the result of internal and external factors.
### Revolutionary Programme
- The revolutionaries did not adopted a violent mass revolution throughout the country at this stage. Instead, they opted to follow in the footsteps of Russian or the Irish nationalists.
- This methodology involved individual heroic actions, such as:
  - Organising assassinations of unpopular officials, traitors and informers among the revolutionaries themselves.
  - Conducting Swadeshi dacoities to raise funds for revolutionary activities (during the First World War), organising military conspiracies with expectation of help from the enemies of Britain.
#### Emergence of Revolutionary Movement
- Disappointed with the outcomes of the work of moderates of Congress, extremists emerged which gave birth to the movement.
- They were inspired by Western ideology. They used to publish literature for the promotion of their ideas.

- Savarkar and his brother organised Mitra Mela, a secret society, in 1899 which merged with Abhinay Bharat (imitating Mazzinni's Young Italy) in 1904. With this, Nasik, Poona and Bombay became Centres of bomb-making.
- In 1909, Jackson, the District Magistrate of Nasik, was killed by Anant Lakshman; who was a member of Abhinav Bharat.

- The British government in May 1907 banned political gathering and Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported and the movement died down here.

- In First World War (1914-1919), Britain allied with France, Russia, USA, Italy and Japan against Germany, Austria Hungary and Turkey.
- Nationalists leaders responded to British participation in war in three ways:
  - Moderates were in favour of offering support to Britishers in war as a matter of duty.
  - Extremists including Tilak supported the war in misbelief that the British Government would provide self-government to Indians as payback.
