# Indian National Movement : First Phase (1885-1915)

- The second half of the 19th century witnesses the emergence of national political consciousness and growth of organised national movement in India.
- A new feeling of oneness and belongingness to the same nation also arised. It gave a new and different path to the movement for independence **Swaraj**.

## Emergence of Nationalism in India
- Consciousness of a common nation began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that come into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers.

### Causes and Rise of Nationalism
- Different causes that led to the rise of nationalism in India are as follows : 
#### Differences in interests of Indians and Britishers
- The root problem of British rule was its selfish interest which was totally different from Indian people. They rules over India and always prioritised their interests over Indian welfare. Indians realised that their interests were being sacrificed over British manufacturers.
- Educated Indians were also dissatisfied with acquired knowledge about economic and political exploits by the British.
- The ruin of Indian economic conditions was also due to this very fact, India was dumped with cheaply made products from machines that destroyed Indian Handicrafts. And at the same place nothing was done in respect of industrialisation in India.
- The peasants also realised that they were suffering due to foreign rule, who took away large part of their produce as revenue, and the police, courts, favoured and protected the *Zamindars* and landlords, who took heavy rents and exploited them.
- They realised *British Capitalism* was not going to modernise Indian economic systems and British policies were meant to help British Capitalists.
- Heavy tarrifs, taxation, and transport policies didn't help Indian capitalists, who were competing against industries favoured by the British.
#### Administrative and Economic Unification
- The sentiments of the nation grew among people after 1857 as India was unified and sense of nationalism emreged during the 19th and 20th centuries.
- The British gradually introduced a uniform system and modern system of government throughout the country and in this way unified it administratively.
- As an economic unit, the country had became a unit and the destruction of local self-sufficient and rural economy interlinked the economic life of different parts of the country. If one area was under drought or famine others also felt shortages of food and prices fluctuations.
- **Introduction of Telegraph, railways** and **unified postal system** had also brought different areas of India together and increased mutual contacts among Indians, particularly among the leaders.
#### Growth of Press, Newspapers and Literature
- The main medium through which the Indian people of nationalist mindset spread their message of patriotism and modern ideas, thoughts, about social, economic conditions was the press.
- Many newspapers with nationalist thoughts emerged during the second half of the 19th century.
- They criticised British policies, perspectives of Indians were put forward, people were involved to unite and work for national betterment.
- Ideas of self-government, democracy and industries were brought in popular mass discussion by the press and newspapers. It also brought people living in different parts of the country together, and helped them exchange their views
